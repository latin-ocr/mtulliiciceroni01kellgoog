Cicero’s instruction (Quint. XII. 11. 6), is accounted one of the
same coterie ,· as also are MESSALLA and cumo. These orators
could not rival Cicero in his amplitude and affluence of speech,
nor in his emotional power. So they fell back on a simpler‚
drier, colder style of speaking, claiming that this alone was
truly Attic. They did not see, as Sandys has pointed out
(Introd. to Orator, p. lxii), that the Latin tongue required
fullness of expression, to keep simplicity from degenerating
into baldneSS. They attained excellence in their chosen style ς
but it was sheer presumption to make for it an exclusive claim.
They conjured with the name of AthenS, as if that would give
them the pre-eminence over the noblest Roman orator. It is
no wonder that he protested against this pseudo-Atticism, and
strove to bring Brutus back to a truer standard and a 'more
inspiring ideal. His judgment was that of his own and of suc-
ceeding ages, The orations of his Atticizing critics were coldly
received (84. 289), and were left to perish: Cicero's were the
delight of his hearers, and were to become the admiration of
many generations of criticS, the treasure of our own far distant
timeS.

5. Quite different was the oratorical degeneracy of the Silver
Age. It was a part of the general literary corruption, and
needs no separate treatment. Oratory suffered the earliest
blight, for the new despotism stifled free speech. The rhetores
became declamatory. Dry themes were substituted for living
questions: see, e.g., the Suasort’ae of the elder Seneca. Un-
classical affectationS, fanciful conceits‚ and brilliant sayings
took the place of direct expression, genuine sentiment, and
sound reasoning. To be quoted was the test of success.
Symmetry was impaired and literary perspective forgotten.

Of course there were exceptionS, and differences among con-
temporaries in this later age. QmeruAN retained much of the
Ciceronian spirit, while yet he is far from Cicero's style. TA015
Tus and PLmv pleaded together —par nobile fratrum —with
much of the old Roman dignity. But the tendency was steadily
