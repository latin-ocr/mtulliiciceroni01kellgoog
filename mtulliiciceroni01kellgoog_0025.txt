a geographical antithesis to Atticism. But degeneracy from
the old Attic standard was as wide-spread as the H ellenic race.
It made more rapid progress away from Athens 3 in Alexandria,
in Sicily, in Asia Minor. Caecilius wrote against Phrygians
much as Matthew Arnold writes against Philistines (cf. Cic.
Or. 8. 25). In the Brutus (13. 51) Cicero seems to set the
Rhodians apart in an intermediate school between the Asian
and the Attic‚ yet pronouncing them Atticorum similiores (cf.
Quint. XII. 10. 18-9). Cicero had personal reasons for com-
plimenting the Rhodian school, as his favorite master Molo
taught there (cf. 91. 3163 and Sandys's Orator, Introd. p.
xxxvii). But critics like Jebb (Att. Or. II. 445—6) disallow the.
tertium quid, counting the Rhodian orators merely as eclectio.
Cicero is certainly not to be classed with Hortensius. ‘It is
often said that he was Asian at first 3 but that as his judgment
matured he threw off most of the Asian characteristics, and
became more Attic‚ like the Rhodians (cf. Jahn, Einl. p. 8).
But juvenile ‘ superfluities ’ and ‘ redundancies' (91. 316) do
not mean Asian corruption of style. We can easily apply Pro-
fessor Jebb’s test. He says (Att. Or. ΙΙ. 439) ε ‘Asianism versus
Atticism means the New versus the Old Oratory. The essential
difference between them is this: the Old Oratory was an art,
and was therefore based upon a theory. The New Oratory was
a knack, and was founded upon practice. Atticism was tech-
nical and, in its highest phase, scientifiC. Asianism was ern-
pirical.' Was Cicero’s early speaking empirical, or did it rely
on a theory? In his youth (cf. Introd. Ι.) he composed an
elaborate treatise on rhetoric ε by the best of tests he was not
then an Asian. The juvenile exuberance to which he confesses
was an excess in degree, not a difference in kind ε cf. de Or. ΙΙ.
2 1. 88, volo esse in adulescente, unde aliquid amputem. And if
Cicero was not Asian in his youth, a fortiori he was not in
later years„ when his maturet judgment chastened his style,
and when he devoted so rnuch of his strength to setting forth
the principles of true and effective oratory and unfolding the
