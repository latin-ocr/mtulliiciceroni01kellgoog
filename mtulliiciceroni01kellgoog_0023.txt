common sense and a biting wit. He wrote a treatise on
rhetoric for his son Marem, from which have been preserved
the definition of an orator (approved by Quintilian, XII. 1. 1),
vir bonus dicendi peritus, and the maxim, rem tene, verba
sequentur. This maxim is good for later times and higher
oratorical training3 but with Cato it meant a style of speaking
that depended on natural ability rather than on rules of art.

2. The Grecizing influence was already coming in. Cato
resisted it long, but in his old age even he learned Greek. In
the generation succeeding, the new culture grew apace, and
Lamus and Seme, born nearly half a century later than Cato,
became its leading representatives. Greek rhetores were now
teachers in oratory. Not all the prominent orators yielded to
the new influence. GALBA clung to the older style, and used
it with an impetuous force resembling Cato's: see the story of
his success (cap. 22) where Laelius failed. But that account
shows that Galba made thorough preparation for his speeches
(cf. Tusc. Ι. 3. 5). The GRAccH1‚ nearly a generation later,
received the full benefit of the Greek erudition. The levitas
Graecorum (25. 96) was first fully attained at Rome by
LEPmUS‚ who became a model for the elder Gracchus (cf.
Ell. Brcv. Eloqu. Rom. ffi‘st. p. 35). CATULUS was ‘deeply
versed in Greek literature ’3 and his is a transition name to
Anmnms and emissus. ,Of these two great oratorS‚ the former
owed to Greek culture more than he was ready to own:
Quintilian (II. 17. 6) calls him dzksimulator artzlv. Crassus
believed in the widest culture and the utmost painstaking.
But as yet there was at Rome no distinctive school of oratory.
There was a free play of individual tendencies. Crassus and
Antonius had different styleS‚ but neither of them was an
imitator.

3. Eloquence took still higher ground in the time of Hor-
tensius and Cicero. The Greek influence had kept pace with
the general culture. The Senate could now listen without an
interpreter to Greek-speaking ambassadors (to Molo first,
