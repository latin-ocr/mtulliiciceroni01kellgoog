INTRODUCHON. xi

Cicero’s political hopes were not quite abandoned. Some
younger men, thoroughly equipped for political life, might yet
bring back the glory of the republic. For public life oratory
was a most important preparation. It was this which had given
him his own civic honors. He would keep alive this power of
speech, for the sake of the State he loved so well. He would,
if possible, train up a generation of noble oratorS, to be a bul-
wark against the encroachments of persona] power.

2. There were special motives to the composition of the
Brutus, such as the following: (1) to trace the development
of Cicero's favorite art3 (2) to show the place of oratory in
public life3 (3) and the equipment needed by the orator
(the shortcomings of the men he named would be an admoni-
tion) 3 (4) to do justice to the earlier Roman oratorS, who
were now undervalued3 (5) to stimulate by example3 (6) to
furnish incentives to patriotic feeling (Greek' orators must be
briefly noticed, but the list would be chiefly Roman, -long
enough and illustrious enough to stir the pulses· of all good
Romans) 3 (7) to gain a vantage-ground for the handling of
certain practical questionS, eg. the difference between the
Asian and the Attic styles of oratory3 (8) to answer criticisms
directed against Cicero himself. Among his critics was the
very man he addressed (see Quint. XII. 1. 22, and Tae. Dial.
18 3 and cf. Quint. XII. ιο. 12). Of these criticisms he was
quite aware (cf. Or. 13. 403 71. 237). To the public at
large he would also make answer. He had an eager desire to
stand well with his countrymen. He believed in his style of
oratory 3 he wished others to believe in it also,

The immediate impelling motive to this treatise was furnished
by a historical work of AtticuS, the Liber Annalis ,· which in its
turn was said by its author to be due to Cicero's de Republica,
written ΒΕ. 54 (cf. de Div. II. 1. 3). Varro’s historical writings
(cf. 15. 60 3 56. 205) had prepared Cicero for this new impulse
from AtticuS.
