tistic treatment; Lysias first professed the art. Theodorus and
Isocrates followed, writing for others3 the latter formed a
system. Athens alone oratorical in Greece. Outside of Greece,
Asian and Rhodian development. Greek oratory pertinent as
an introduction to Roman.

Roman Oratory, 5 3-329.

53-57. The earliest Roman oratorS‚ of whom little is known:
BrutuS, App. ClaudiuS, ete.

57-76. Better known: CetheguS, the ‘ marrow of persua-
sion ' 3 Cat0‚ to be compared with Lysias 3 now neglected, but
worthy of study3 rough‚ but excellent, like the early statues
and paintings and poemS.

77—80. Cato’s earlier contemporaries: the elder Africanus,

AEliuS, etc. Later contemporaries: GalluS, Gracchus, Cor-
culum, ete.

81—94. ‘Numerous successors of Cato: MetelluS‚ etc.; best ,

of all, Laelius, the younger AfricanuS‚ Galba. Galba outdid
Laelius. Why his speeches read poorly.

‘94-102. Between Galba and the Gracchi: Lepidus (who
became a model to Ti. Gracchus), CrassuS, etc.

103-126. The Gracchan era: Ti. Gracchus (instructed by
Cornelia), Carb0‚ F uriuS, Scaevola, App. ClaudiuS, the Drusi,
ete. 3 Scaurus the ‘ antique,’ Rutilius the Stoic (few Stoics are
oratorS,) Curio, ete. 3 C. Gracchus, superior to all.

127-138. From the Gracchi to Crassus: C. Galba, Nasica,
Calvinus, etc.; Catulus (with a modern finish), ScauruS, Mar-
celluS, etc. ’

139-164. Oratory reaches maturity. Antonius and Crassus
described and compared3 Crassus and Scaevola, the compari-
son of whom suggests to Brutus a like comparison of Cicero
and Sulpicius· Cicero sets aside his own name, but eulogizes
Sulpicius, and Brutus laments the evil times which have silenced
both. ‘ Hush,' from :Atticus Crassus marks the first maturity
of Roman eloquence 3 his speech on the Servilian law a model.
