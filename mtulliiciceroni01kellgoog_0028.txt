downward. Roman oratory had reached its culminating point
in Cicero, and to him there is no second nor third among the
later Romans.

VIII. Tm: Tm or THE Baeows.

The Manuscripts os the Brutus derive from a single copy,
found at Lodi‚ in 1422, by Bishop Gherardo landriani. The
copy included the other chief rhetorical works of Cicer0, and
was of essential service in filling out the text of de Oratore.
This copy was sent to Milan, to Gasparino Barziza‚ and was
turned over for transcription to several hand83 Brutus, to
Blondus Flavius of Milan. The original Codex Laudeusis was
neglected and lost. Copies were rapidly multiplied; and from
the 'circumstances of the case the various extant Mss, differ
less than is usual in classica] texts, The original was not in
perfect condition; as is shown by the imperfect ending, and
in a few other placeS‚ where one or more words have fallen out.
The Mss, of the Brutus collated by Lagomarsini (for his
laborS‚ cf. Wilkins’s de Or. p. 61) are of differing value: two
of them, with one Venetian and one Vatican Ms.‚ are put by
Ellendt in the first rank, as of nearly equal excellence and
authority: cf. Stangl, Introd., and Heerdegen, Jahrb. 1885,
pp. 105—112. For an account of other Mss, see Ell. Praef.
p. vi sq. 3 Sandys’s Orator, Introd. p. lxxxii sq. Kayser (Praef.
p. xx) says, Bruti in universum codices aliquoties laudavi: om-
nes recentes sunt et aequali jere dignitate praeth‘ti.

The Editio princeps (Pid. Einl. p. 32) dates at Rome, 146 5-
67. Among the best modern editions are those of Ellendt,
Meyer 8: Bernhardy, Peter, Orelli δε Baiter, O. Jahn (re-
vised by Eberhard), Baiter & Kayser, Piderit, and Stangl.
These editions have been enriched and supplemented by the
criticisms of Lambian Ernesti, Schiitz, Bake, and others,
'The labors of all these scholars, based on an original os no
inferior merit, have brought the text of the Brutus to an
unusually satisfactory condition.
