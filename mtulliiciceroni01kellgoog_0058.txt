24 CICERO.

similiter . . . primo: cf. primo
above.

quasi: to intimate that the Ro-
man law is referred to only by way
of illustration3 cf. 63.

contra legem: sometimes in
legem, or lege. The law referred to
was one of the leges Semproniae
proposed by C. Gracchus, B.c. 123,
and was renewed by Sulla, B.c. 82,
in the lex Cornelia de sicariis: cf.
pro Clu. 55. 151.

vocaretur: Ell. remarks that this
part of Cicero's account is taken
from writers ignorant of the Attic
custom; and he refers to Quint. ΙΙ.
15. 30, Socrates inhonestam sibi
credidit orationem, quam ei Lysias
reo composuerat, et tum maxime
scribere litigatoribus, quae illi pro
se ipsi dicerent, erat moris, atque
ita iuri, quo non licebat pro altero
agere, fraus adhibebatur. Cf. Spald-
ing’s note on the passage. At
Athens, at first, one could not em-

ploy an advocate, unless himself

disabled from pleading his own
case. But it became customary to
procure help from some trained
lawyer and orator, who would com·

pose an address for the litigant 3 and
the next step was to ask permission
for a friend to continue the argu-
ment begun hythe litigant. Thus
it is supposed that Ctesiphon said
something for himself, though we
have no record of it, in the trial im-
mortalized by. Demosthenes. See
Felton's Gracc, ΙΙ. 123; Mahaffy's
Gr. Lit. ΙΙ. 137; D'Ooge's Dem.
on the Crown, Pref.

se . . . transtulisse = ‘turned
his attention!

artis: i.e. treatises containing in—
structions and illustrative exercises;
cf. JuV. VII. 177, artem scindes
Theodori.

13. 49. fetus: 182.

rationem: this Protean word has
here its primary meaning. ·

Athenarum: de Or. I. 4. 13,
Athenas, in quibus summa dicendi
vis et inventa est et perfecta ,· Vell.
I. 18, una urbs Attica pluribus
annis eloquentiae quam universa
Graecia operibusque floruit. Ora·
torically‚ Athens stands for Greece.
If Athens had not existed, would
the Romans be overshadowed by
the Greeks?
