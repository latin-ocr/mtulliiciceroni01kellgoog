neglected. But it is known to have
been extant in the tenth century: in
the seventeenth it had disappeared.
Portions of it, including the Som-
nium Scipionis, were preserved in
the writings of Macrobius, and in
those of St. Augustine. In 1820,
Cardinal Mai discovered large por·
tions of the work on a palimpsest
of Augustine's commentaries on the
Psalms. The restored Ms. is con·

This treatise was in six Books, and
was regarded by Cicero and his
friends as one of the most important
of his writingS. The scene of the
dialogue was laid m the gardens of
the younger Africanus, the chief in·
terlocutor; the time is B.C.129. In
the confusion of the closing years
of the Roman Republic, and the

ered. For a notice of the scope of
the work (and of de Legibus), see
Gibbon, Chap. 44. A new edition
was issued in 1884, at London, from
Mai’s third edition of 1846. Brit-
ish scholarship will doubtless call
for another.
