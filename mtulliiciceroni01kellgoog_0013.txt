Cicero’s Brutus holds a definite and unique place among his
rhetorical writings. These writings are, de Inventione, de Ora-
tore, Brutus, Orator, a'e Optimo Genere Oratorum, de Partitione
Oratoria, Topica.

Of these treatises de Inventione was a youthful production
written, as Weidner thinks, 13.C. 84-83. Cicero himself depre-
ciated it at a later day (de Or. 1. 2. 5) as quae pueris aut adu-
lescentulis nobis ex commentariolis· nostris incohata ac rudia
exciderunt. The last three treatises in the above list are of
minor importance ς a'e Optimo Genere Oratorum being merely a
preface to Cicero’s lost translation of the two great speeches in
the case of Ctesiphon; a'e Partitione Oratoria, a catechetical
outline drawn up for the young Marcus Cicero 3 Topica, a
summary (written on ship-board, from recollection) based on
the Topics of Aristotle. The three remaining works form a
serieS, giving us a complete account of the theory and practice
of oratory among the Romans to the middle of the last century
13.c. De Oratore, completed 13.c. 55, is the earliest, the most
elaborate, and the most important of these treatises. The Bru-
tus comes next in order, but after an interval of more than eight
years, Herein the principles laid down in the former work find
a historical and practical application. The Orator, written the
following year, furnishes an ideal standard. (Cf. Hamecker,
Jahrb. 125.) Thus we have, first, an oratorical system3 sec· -
ondly, a story of oratorical attainments; and thirdly, an ideal
of oratorical perfection.
