sive periods of their prominence, he was the friend of Caesar
and Pompey, of Brutus and Cas-sim, of Antony and Octavian.
But his most intimate friend was Cicero 3 a friendship attested-
by the very frank letters written to him by Cicer0, so many of
which have come down to uS. They cover a period of nearly
twenty-five years, The two men had been fellow-students in
youth (Nep. Att. 1). In a letter to Memmius (ad Fam. XIII. 1.
5) Cicero sayS, Pomponium Atticum sic amo ut alterum fra-
t1·em,· nihil est illo mihi nec carius nec iucundius . . . est enim
omni liberali doctrina polim-simus. Cicero could appeal to
him for critical judgments: cf. acl Att. I. 14. 3, meis orationi-
bus, quarum tu Aristarchus es. They were not alike in the
tenor of their lives 3 and because Atticus was in retirement, he
was fitted to soothe Cicero’s political disquietude (see 3. 11 3
42. 157). He was competent to enliven this dialogue by inter-
posing objections. As an antiqu-arian he was second only to
Varr0‚ and could settle historical points. When he made no

silent assent. As he was not a partisan, he could speak the
praises of Caesar. (Cf. Pid. Einl. p. 28.)

Atticus was also an intimate friend of Brutus (see Nep. Att.
8—9‚ 16). He was 24 years the senior, but outlived Brutu5‚ and
died 13.c. 32, of voluntary starvation.

logue‚ corresponding to Sulpicius and Cotta in de Oratore.
As one who is still a learner, he calls out the master's fuller
opinionS‚ and leads him to open some pages of his experience.
Brutus was of distinguished plebeian extraction: his father, of
the same name, was tribune 13.c. 83, and is spoken of (62. 222)
as a good lawyer and ¹a capable statesman. Brutus was born
B.c. 85. Having lost his father at the age of eight, he was
adopted by his uncle, Q. Servilius Caepio, and for this reason,
he is sometimes called Q. Caepio BrutuS. His education was
conducted by his mother Servilia, assisted by her brother
Caepio and her half-brother Cato Uticensis, With the latter
