theory of his art. He knew and described Asianism in oratory ς
and he knew that he was not an Asian. “

We must not be misled by the colder character of our Eng-
lish and American oratory. There is not tropical fervor in
Cicer0, nor oriental display3 but there is the glow and the
gleam of sunny Italy. Yet what adherence to logie! What
careful processes of reasoningl What constant appeals to the
intellect, even more than to the feelings 1

Cicero was an Atticist: not of the severer type, like Caesar3
not a counterpart os Demosthenes Atticism was not bounded
by hard and fast lines (cf. 82. ²85),· From the very outset
there were varying phases in Attic oratory (cf. Jebb, II.
419 sq.). Demosthenes (ibid. 398) had ‘an eclectic and re-
combining geniuS,’ reproducing now the style of ThucydideS,
now that of Lysias, and again that of Isocrates: (cf. Volkmann,
Rhet. der Gr. u. Rb'm. p. 459.) In like manner Cicero fur-
nishes examples of three styles (ibid. 456) 3 but always with an
individuality os his own. Quintilian (X. 1. 106) says of De-
mosthenes and Cicero: quorum ego virtutes plerasque arbitror
similes. Cf. Kayser, Praef. p. x: Demosthenes Romanam gravi-
tatem spirat, Cicero Graecam suavitatem redolet ‚· -and Quint.
X. 1. 108-9.

As a public speaker Cicero turned the tide from the Asianism
of Hortensius (cf. Jahn, Einl. p. 7). Jebb affirms (Att. Or. II.
450) that Cicero was the representative at Rome of the Atticist
revival.

4. Eloquence began to fall away from the Ciceronian stan-
dard even in Cicero’s time. There was criticism of the great
orator and a reaction from his influence. BRUTUS has been
noticed as one of these critics (cf. adAtt. XIV. 20. 3). CALvus
was another, styled by Fr. Muuer the chief pseudo-Atticist
(cf. Jahn, Einl. p. 10 5 Sen. Controv. 7. 4 3 Tac. Dial. 183
Quint. XII. 1. 223 X. 1. 115). We may add the Asinii, father
and son (cf. Quint. XII. 1. 22 3 IX. 4. 1. It was Asinius Pollio
who charged Livy with Patavinity 1) . CAELms, who had enjoyed
