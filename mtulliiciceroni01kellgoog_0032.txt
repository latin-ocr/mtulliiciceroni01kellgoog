xxviii 1NTRonthr10N.

248-262. ‘ Do speak of two living men,’ says Brutus», ‘ Caesar
and Marcellus! ‘N 0, you.' So Brutus eulogizes MarcelluS, and
Atticus Caesar, recalling Caesar's high opinion of Cicero: (ora-
tor and general compared.) Caesar’s pure and correct style,
with fit ornament and noble delivery. Return to the dead.

263-282. Sicinius was helped by the system of Hermagoras3
then come Visellius, Torquatus, Triarius 3 (another groan at the
losses of the troubled State 3) App. ClaudiuS, etc., the two Lm-
tuli, Postumius 3 (‘ Going low again,' says Atticus 3) Piso (Cic-
ero's son-in-law), Caelius, etc„ Calidius (who lacked the third
power of the orator), Curio (of a too hasty ambition).

283-300. Calvus was polished‚ but too dry, affecting Atti-
cism. The Attic orators not alike. The speeches in Thucyd-
ides not pattems for the orator. Demosthenes is a model: are
these new Atticists like him ? He drew crowds: do they? Is
there, asks Atticus, a Socratic irony in your account? eg. in
comparing Cato to Lysias3 in placing later orators so high.
No irony: the praise is genuine, and touches few out of the
many named. Brutus ι ‘ Analyze for us some of those old ora-
tions! Cicero: ‘Gladly, another time, at Cumae or Tusculum!

301-304. Now, at last, HortensiuS, who came forward very
young, and rivalled even Crassus and Antonius: his memory3
his painstaking3 his varied excellencieS. In his glory when
Cicero came forward.

305-316. Cicero’s training: listening to orators3 lessons
from Scaevola, Philo, Molo, Diodotus3 unremitting study and
practice. Entrance on public life, and immediate success:
breaking off 3 study at Athens; journeyman's tour in Asia3
study at Rhodes 3 return to Rome in good oratorical ‘ form.'

317—324. Cotta and Hortensius then reigning orators3 the
latter the best mark for rivalry. Cicero was soon a match for
him. The older man had slackened his industry, and the
younger passed him. One more effort to prevent eclipse 3 then
Hortensius gracefully yielded the precedence, and till death was
a good friend and fellow-worker.
