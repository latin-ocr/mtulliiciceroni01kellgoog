he went to Cyprus B.C. 58, the year of Cicero’s banishment.
Returning thence he remained aloof from politics, and in B.C.
5 3 accompanied his father-in-law, App. ClaudiuS, to Cilicia.

Cicero succeeded Claudius in Cilicia, and was annoyed at find· ’

ing himself called on to enforce certain usurious demands for κ

money loaned by Brutus to the inhabitants of Salamis, in χ
Cyprus (cf. note 4. 17). In the great struggle which came ι

on, BrutuS, contrary to expectation‚ sided with Pompey. He
was spared in battle at Caesar's instance3 he begged and
received the conqueror’s pardon‚ and turned himself to literary
pursuitS. In 46 ac. he was sent by Caesar to Cisalpine Gaul
as governor; but at the time os this writing he was still in
Rome. In his province he had a successful and popular
administration. The year following he offended Cicero by his
treatment of the Catilinarian conspiracy in his published eulogy
on Cato (cf. ad. Att. XII. 21). In 44 B.C. he helped to slay
the dictator3 and in 42 B.C. he took his own life after the
defeat at Philippi.

Brutus was not a dear and fast friend of Cicero. His nature
was cold and selfish, while yet he was fanciful, superstitious,
and unbalanced. In the matter of the Cilician demands Cicero
makes free complaint to their common ffiend Atticus (ad Att.
VI. 1 5 VI. 3. 7). He might well say (ad Att. VI. 1. 6) accipiam
equidem dolorem mihi illum irasci, sed multo maiorem, non
esse eum talem, qualem putassem. But there was much in
Brutus to which Cicero, at this stage of their friendship, would
be attracted. Brutus was a lover of philosophy, and wrote
some philosophical treatises (cf. Acad. Ι. 3. 12 3 Brut. 31. 120).
His diligence in study was remarkable (cf. Quint. X. 7. 27).
He had unusual force of character: cf. ad Att. XIV. ιἶ 2, where
Caesar is quoted as saying of BrutuS, quicquid vult, valde vult.
He made excellent speecheS, whose chief lack was that of an
oratorical glow: lena'tudo and tepor are terms applied to them
by Tacitus (Dial. 21). On the whole, the two men were
in close intellectual sympathy3 and Cicero found more in
