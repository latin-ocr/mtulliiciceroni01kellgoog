‘Peoermke mutto ac lacu = musto quod in lacu est. Friedrich (Jahrb.
121) , making the illustration cover four groups of orators, ((a) vetere
(vino), (b) quandam aetatem, (c) nova, (d) de dolio,) would read in our
text, et novam aut istam quasi de musto, etc.; and thinks that at the
end of 287, after suavitatem, nec nova (sc. aetas) has fallen out.

88. 302. eorum: so Jahn and Pid., after Orel., for the Mss. mernor et.

89. 304. utique: Jahn's emendation for the Mss. uterque.

89. 307. eodem . . . magistro: reads like a gloss from 312, where
‘Molo's name is introduced as if it were neW. Kayser (Praefl B. and K„
p. xi) refers to it as a manifest interpolation. The interval between the
two timeS, if both accounts are retained, is six years,

91. 315. fuiquex well inserted by B. and K. ; otherwise it would read
as if the oratores were, like Cicer-0, on a tour. The context shows that
they were at home. Other proposed emendations are more violent; eg.
(Jahn) dum summis studeo oratoribus; (Pid.) et summis quidem
oratoribus usus sum. Bake (Mnemosyne 6) more neatly brackets
quibuscum.

92. 317. quod: Jahn and B. and K. read cui.

93. 321. et in his post aedilitatem annis3 these words seem to have
crept into the Mss, as a gloss.

95. 325. faceto: Jahn and B. and K„ facte, which Sandys (Introd. to
Or. p. xxxvi) renders artificial.

95. 327. adulescens: bracketed by En. and B. and K„ as inconsist-
ent with the progress of the narration3 but cf. Peter’s defence‚ Proxime
enim antecedentibus dixerat, Hortensium ab adulescentibus probatum esse ,·
iam aliud est, adulescentem probari, idque nunc ei dicendum est, quod ad
alteram causam, cur in senectute minus probatus sit, pergit, hanc, quia
senex idem fuerit atque adulescens.
