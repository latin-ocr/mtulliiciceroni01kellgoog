great Roman orator. Certain failings in his conduct are only
too apparent. He was free to speak his own praises ; but if we
scan the acts of other distinguished RomanS, eg. Cato, and
Scipio, and Pompey, we shall agree with Professor Greenough‚
that ‘ modesty, real or assumed, is a late growth of civilization.’
Cicero was irresolute in some important crises. But he showed
undaunted courage in his speech for Roscius, in his suppression
of the Catilinarian conspiracy, in his fruitless opposition to An-
tony. The title of pater patriae befitted him as a true Roman
and patriot. In adversity he made pitiful complaints3 but
these were private outbursts of feeling, not‘ to be judged as
public or deliberate utteranceS. Other men could lament, and
none save sympathizing friends would know it: Cicero’s mar-
vellous charm of style has robbed his life of its just privacy. He
was a man of unimpeached integrity and purity of character.
His ideal of an orator demanded high aims and eminent virtues,

Cicero’s range of studies and acquisitions gave him broad
and just views. He was omnivorous in his studies3 not in a
superficial or hap-hazard way, but as an earnest student, and
always with special reference to his function as an orator.
Beyond cavil he was a finished literary artist, No style ever
wrought so great a change as that of Cicero, Before him Latin
prose was more or less awkward and cumbrous ς’ in him it
sprang at once to perfection. A style which holds its own,

 

century after century, implies a cultivated power of thought ,

that betokens the best qualifications for criticism. As a sympa-
thetic advocate, he might exaggerate the merits of a client's
case; but in such criticism as the Brutus contains there was
little temptation to exaggerate. He was one of the orators’
own craft, glorying in their art, and understanding their real
strength.

studied. CATO was rugged and pointed, with a strong, piercing
