44. 162. defensio: the Mss. defensione iuncta seems corrupt ; de·
fensio-ne was perhaps written by the copyist under the influence of
Caepione.

46. 171. audies tu quidem: H. A. Koch (Rh. Mus. 16. 485) thinks
the tu misplaced (ef. tu . . . intelleges), and reads audies ibiquidem3
so Jahn. Weidner and Stangl, tum quidem.

47. 175. sine 11113 oratione: an emendation of Bake for simili rati-
one, which is retained in most editions.

48. 178. multum erat: emendations proposed are multus, and rnul-
tarurn3 for multus, cf. Sall. lug. 963 and one reading of Tac. Agr. 20.

49. 181. ignoratione: H. A. Koch (Rh. Mus. 16. 486) ‘mit Kayser,'
magna ratione. Δ

superioris aetatis: Pid. et al. transfer these words and read ignora-
tione superioris aetatis.

eorum . . . vidimus: reads like a gloss.

51. 191. centum milium: Orel. and Ell. have omnium. Merito
ille et recte, from ed. pr. The Mss„ omniurn me illurn et recte.
Various emendations have been proposed. Peter reads omnium milium,
and cites ad Att. 11. 5. ις pro lege Man. 5. 113 de Fin. II. 31. 102. Β.
and K. (in 0111 text) adopt an earlier conjecture of Orel., with which the
first of Peter’s citations better agrees, Cato ille noster, qui mihi unus est
pro centum milibus.

52. 197. aut expectaret aut: bracketed or omitted by some editors
as a gloss.

58. 197. effecisse, hoc illo initio: most of the Mss. have hoc in illo
initio, of which Ell. says, ferri non potest. His own reading is hoc ille
initio, of which he says, hanc meam olim coniecturam firmant ed. pr. et
liber ottobianus. Β. and K. insert est et after consecutus, and point,
sententiis: delectavit. 0111· text follows Orel. et al.

54.199. auditori probari: Pid., after Ernesti, oratori3 another read·
ing is existimatori (cf. 200).

54.200 200. avem: the change to avis (Pid.) is unauthorized, and weak·
0113 1110 eomparison. F. W. Schmidt (Jahrb. 87) proposes ut suavi for
ut avem.

56. 204. inquam: hardly necessary ς Orel. and ΕΠ. do not insert.

56. 206. nec studuit: before these words Tittler (Jahrb. 99) would
insert esse.

57. 207. Cotta: before this word something seems to have been lost.
Orel. and En. follow Lambinus in inserting secundum Philippum et
Caesarem. Eberh. and Stangl insert rarius.

expetebantur. another reading 1s exspectabantur.

57. 208. maximi: Buttmann' s emendation for maxime of the Mss.;
approved by 0101.. Eu„ Β. and K.

58. 213. inluminatam: some editors deem this word a corruption of
inligatam: this may itself, as Ell. supposes, be a gloss ; and so B. and K.
