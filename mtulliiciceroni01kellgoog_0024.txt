13.c. 81) . Richer forms os oratory were developed under the
touch of HORTENsms (cf. 88. 302). Latin masters of eloquence
had begun to win attention: the first of these was Plotius
Gallus, who began to teach Ι about the time os the death of
Crassus, These Latin rhetores, like the Greeks os an earlier
time, were held at first in disfavor (cf. Merivale's Abeken,
p. 5 ε Ell. Brev. Hist. pp. 57, 97). Gnipho, a Roman with a
Greek education‚ instructed both Caesar and Cicero: but to
the end of the republiC, oratory was deemed so much a foreign
product that Romans tenacious of ancient ways thought it, as
Ellendt says, base to teach what it was honorable to leam.

The larger development of oratory in this age was due, not
only to a wider range of knowledge and thought, but also to
the character of the times, They were times of faction‚ which
often broke into violence. Sulla’s shadow, before passing away,
fell upon Cicero as well as upon Caesar. Cicero's consulship
encountered the Catilinarian conspiracy. His banishment was
the work of the bruta] Clodius. His Philippics were, like those
of Demosthenes, the last but magnificent flame of the state’s
expiring liberty. Such an age called forth all the powers of
men who would control and guide the turbulent people. ⁸

In this advanced period of Roman oratory we find differing
tendencies in marked contrast. Three men may be taken as
illustrative of the period 3 CICERO, his elder contemporary HOR-
TENsmS, and the man of universal geniuS, CAESAR. They had
three different styles of oratory. Of Caesar’s orations none are
extant3 but we may know from his own writingS, as well -as
from Roman criticism, something of their character: they must
have been at once simple and elegant in language, concise,
closely and clearly logical, weighty, and effective from a certain
personal authority. They might be compared with those of
the simpler and severer Attic oratorS.

Hortensius was at an opposite extreme from the simplicity
of Caesar. From B.c. 95 (see Jebb, Att. Or. II. 447) he was
the Latin representative of Asianism. Asianism is, of cou'rse,
