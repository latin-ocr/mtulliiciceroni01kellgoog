xii INTRODUCTION.

III. THE DATE Am) THE CmcuMSTANcEs.

The composition of the Brutus is assigned to the early
months of the year 46 13.c. Caesar had brought the Alexan—
drine war to a close, defeated Pharnaces in Pontus, returned
to Rome and secured a third dictatorship, and departed for
Africa to crush Scipio and Cat0. All this was in the year
47 B.c. The. decisive battle in Africa, at ThapsuS, was fought
April 6th‚ B.c. 46, and the two Pompeian leaders speedily took ,
their own liveS. These events had not yet been reported at
Rome: see, e.g., 31. 118 and 58. 212, where Cato and Scipio ⁴
are spoken of as still living. In various places Cicero shows a
remaining gleam of hope for the success of the Pompeians, and
ventures on mournful reflections and open regretS, and even
personal allusionS, as he would hardly have done later in that
year. For the illusive rumors that kept his hopes alive, cf., e.g.,
ad Att. XII. 2. 1, written in April. For invidious allusions to
Caesar himself, see 6. 24 and 81. 281, and what is supposed to
have been a hint to BrutuS, 14. 53, to emulate the Brutus of

old.

IV. THE FORM AND THE TrrLE.

1. Plato’s dialogues might well tempt Cicero to cast his
treatises in a like mould. Most of his philosophical and rhetori—
cal works are nominally dialogues, But he found it hard to
keep them from running into monologues. And so the Aristo-
telian dialogues fumished Cicero a more ‘acceptable model.
In describing his treatise de Oratore he sayS, (ad Att. XIII. 19.
4) quae autem his temporibus scripsi, Ἀριστοτέλειον morem
liabent, in quo sermo ita inducitur ceterorum, ut penes ipsum sit
principatus .· (cf. Watson’s Select Letters of Cicera, p. 214).
Theophrastus, whom (de Div. II. 1. 4) he ‘classes with Aristotle
as a model, had imitated this style of dialogue. In the Brutus
there is more interchange of thought than is usual in Cicero's
dialogues, with a corresponding gain in vivacity.
