this college was now made by seven·
teen (determined by lot) out of the
thirty· -five tribes. The elections were
originally made by the comitia cu·
riata, the Patrician body3 after·
ward by the college itsels. Their
choice was called cce-optatio (see
first meaning of optare). The Do·
mitian law, Β. c. 103, gave the elec-
tion to the people. Sulla restored
it to the college. When hisv law was
repealed, the choice was left to the
people, but was to be from names
(probably three) presented by the
augnrs themselves. Thus the col-
lege was virtually sels-perpetuating.
From Phil. ΙΙ. 2. 4, we learn that
but two augurs made the nomina·
tion (nec enim licebat α pluribus
nominari), and that the two who
nominated Cicero were Pompey and
Hortensius.

deminutam: de·minuere‚ to les-
sen by taking from, is a different
word from di·minuere, to break
into small pieces. The English and
F rench derivatives have the mean-
ing of the former with the vowel of
the latter. Later Latin sometimes
weakened the e in deminutio.

cooptatum z co-optatio was choice

by the college3 but as the result os
the nominatio it is here ascribed
to Hortensius. Cicero became an
augur B.C. 53, taking the place of
the young Crassus, slain in the Par·
thian war. The college, since Sulla's
time, contained fifteen memberS.

iudicium dignitatis meae: ι’. e.
a judicial declaration that 1 was a
worthy candidate3 a solemnity re·
quired of the nominator.

inauguratum, installed (with
due sacred rites). One augur could
perform the ceremony. cs. Liv. 1.
18, and Seeley' s note.
f ρῖτεητίεε the college was like a
ami y.

2. molestiam. i. e. the burden
(ef. moles) os my sorroW.

alienissimo, most inopportune:
when the state was on the eve of
civil war.

desiderium, regret (for the loss
of). cs. desideraret, 6.

laboris: especially their public
apd great services in critical times.
c 323.

3. leviorum artium. the polite
arts were in a Romau’ s estimation
inferior to practical statesmanship.

Cf. deor. Ι. 49. 212.
