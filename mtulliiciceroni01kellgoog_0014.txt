11. THE Mo‘rrvEs To ns CoMPosrrmN.

1. There were some general motives which apply to this
whole series 3 which apply in part to the other products of this
very prolific pen.

These treatises fumished occupation for a restless and disap-
pointed man. Cicero’s activity and energy were as remarkable
as Caesar's 3 but, unlike Caesar, he found his politica] career cut
short. He was on the losing side in vthe great struggle which
culminated at Pharsalus, Cicero could ill bear misfortune, as
is shown by his plaints when he was in exile. But he had an
unfailing resource and refuge in literary activity. When the
world became· intolerable‚ he did not sink into idle despond-
ency; he still had courage to shut himself away from his sor-
roWS, and occupy his mind with theoretical politicS, with philos-
ophy, with ethics and religion, with the theory and history of
the great art in which he was acknowledged master.

Cicero was fond of communicating his thoughts to otherS‚ of
sharing with them his intellectual treasureS. Hence his attempts
to popularize at Rome the Greek philosophy. As an orator he
was ready to advise and stimulate his juniorS. It was an old
Roman fashion‚ not then extinct, to attach one's self to an older
and wiser man for instruction ε cf. TacituS, Dial. a'e Or. 34, who
’ in the next chapter complains of the decay of this good old
custom. Cicero himself had gone to Scaevola for instruction in
law. In his turn he ‘ coached ’ younger orators (cf. Quint. XII.
1 1 . 6, sic aa' se Caelium deductum a patre Cicero profitetur, sic
Pansam, Hirtium, Dolabellam in morem praeceptoris exercuit
cotidie dicens audiensque: 6. 2 3. n.). This was a gratuitous ser-
vice, done from kindness and a love of communicating. The
relation held by the young men to the older man was a sort of
noble clientship. In his writings Cicero took in a larger client-
age. He makes it evident that he was anxious to benefit others
(cf. a'e Dio. ΙΙ. 1. 1, quaerenti mihi multumque et diu cogitanti
quanam re possem prodesse quam plurimis).
