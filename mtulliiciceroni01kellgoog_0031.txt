INTRODUcrmN. xxvii

165-168. Lesser Roman names,

ι 169-172. From the Allies and Latins: they lack the color
urbamtattk (story of Theophrastus at Athens).

. 173-182. Romans again, in the wake of Crassus and Anto-
nius: PhilippuS, OctaviuS, etc. 3 the polished and witty.Caesar;
many others, including two coarse but acute rabulae. Apology
for so full a list.

183-200. After Caesar, a numerous progeny, of whom
Cicero and the public declare Cotta and Sulpicius chief. The
vox populi coincides with the best criticism 3 eg. concerning
Crassus and AntoniuS, Cotta and HortensiuS, aud (adds Brutus)
Cicero, Demosthenes could not speak to Plato alone : as the
flute to the musician, so is an audience to the orator. The
public may overrate‚ for lack of comparison, as Scaevola at
first, but Crassus dashes him down. Advantage of the skilled
critic:

201—220. Cotta and Sulpicius very unlike3 one quiet, the
other tragic. No speech of either extant. No rival to them in
this younger set ; they got all the cases left by the older orators ε
there was not then the poor fashion of dividing up a case.
Curio was brilliant, but very deficient.

221-233. Others were VariuS, PomponiuS, etc. There were
specialists in speaking, including the father of Brutus : popular
haranguerS, such as the seditious SaturninuS, Glaucia (worst of
demagogues), Titius (he of the ‘Titian jig'). ‘Of the age of
Sulpicius: Antistius and Sisenna. Hortensius belongs to that
period, as well as to the later. The history comes down to the
living, of whom Cicero declines to speak: promises to tell his ·
own experience. But more names remain of the dead.

233—247. Contemporary with Hortensius: Crassus (the tri-
umvir), the Leutuli, M. Piso, Macer, Pompeius MagnuS, etc.;
and of a poorer sort AutroniuS, StaienuS, etc, ‘ Dregs Ξ ’ eries
AtticuS. But we can see how few excel. Add a few names:
the two Metelli, MarcellinuS, etc.
