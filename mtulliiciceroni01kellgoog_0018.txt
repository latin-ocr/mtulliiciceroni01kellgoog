xiv INTRODUcrmN.

Cicero’s dialogues the dramatis personae are placed far from
the noisy city: in this one there is the relief of an urban lawn
(see 6. 24).

The conversation is represented as near the time os writing 3
not a whole generation earlier, as in de Oratore (13.c. 91 and
55), nor a whole century, as in de Senectute (B.c. 150 and 44).

A speech of Brutus for Deiotarus (see 5. 21, and cf. Tae.
Dial. 21) had occasioned a conversation concerning orators
between Cicero and AtticuS. Atticus had reported the conver-
sation to BrutuS‚ and both friends now besought Cicero to
resume it. He complies -with their request, and enters on a
complete account of Roman orators down to his own time, but
declines to discuss the merits of those who were living, himself
included. The questions of the interlocutors, however, lead
him to waive this rule in a few caseS.

1. Trrus POMPONIUS Amcus was now 63 years of age, having
been born B.c. 109. His father was T. Pomponius, a Roman
knight 3 his mother Caecilia, sister of Q. Caecilius· He received
a liberal education, and was distinguished for his scholarship.
Being still -young when his father died, he was adopted by his
rich uncle. His adoptive name, by which Cicero addresses
him on his inheriting the uncle's property, was Q. Caecilius Q.
F. Pomponianus Atticus (ad Att. III. κ). He refused to be
drawn into the political entanglements of his times, and de-
voted his life to study and literary leisure. For more than
twenty years he resided at Athens; and he was of so much
service to its citizens that there was general mourning at his
departure (B.c. 65). His sumame, AtticuS, was presumably
acquired by this long residence. His ability and courtesy
gained him the esteem of the foremost men of the various par-
ties at Rome. Sulla, who met him at Athens, overlooked his
Marian affinitieS‚ and made him valuable gifts. In the succes-
