INTRODUCTION. xiii

The dialogue form gives opportunity for manifold views of
the subject, for bringing out salient pointS‚ for introducing per-
sonal experience, for strokes of criticism‚ for digressions and
apologieS. Cicero is aware, for example, that he injures the
artistic effect of this treatise by calling up so many names:
Atticus complains of this, and Cicero makes his excuse.

2. The title is taken from one of the interlocutorS‚ the one,
as it happens, whose part is least prominent. Atticus was
older than Brutus, and has a larger share in the dialogue. But
in so far as the treatise is didactic, it was specially intended
for this younger man. Notwithstanding their different posi-
tions and divergent viewS‚ Brutus was the one rising orator on
whom Cicero had fixed his hopes: cf. aa' Att. XIV. 20. 3, qni
rem publicam putem pendere e Bruto. There was also a cer-
tain intellectual sympathy between them, as is evinced by the
dedication to Brutus of so many of Cicero’s philosophical writ-
ings‚—de Finibus, T asculan Disputan'ons, de Natura Deorum,
and Paradoxa. The Orator was also addressed to BrutuS.

The author refers to his treatise by this title 3 Or. 7. 23, in
illo sermone nostro, qui est expositus in Bruto .· cf. tle Div. II.
1. 4.

De Claris Oratoribus is a sub-title, like a'e Senectute for Cato
Maior, and de Amicitia for Laelius. Such double titles are
rare with Cicero, but common enough with preceding writers.
Plato’s works were often quoted in this way (eg. Menexe-
nus sive ἐπιτάφιος) 3 though the sub-titles seem not to have
been Plato’S, but to have been appended by the Alexandrian
critics. Varro's Logtston'ci fumished a nearer precedent, with
such double titles as Marius de Fortuna, Messalla tle Valetu-
dine, Tubero de Origine Humana. We need not hesitate to
ascribe the sub-title of the Brutus to the author
