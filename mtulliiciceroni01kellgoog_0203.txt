TEXTUAL NOTEs, 169

dicit: a reading suggested in Jahn for the Mss, dici: exstet is Stangl's
emendation for esset. If dici and esset are retained, we may regard
this part of the sentence as a compressed form of stating two ideas: and
it may be filled out (following the form of the first part of the sentence)
somewhat as follows: nihil subtiliter, etc., dici potuit [quod ille non dix-
erit— immo nihil quod ille ita dixerit] , ut eo fieri possit aliquid limatius ,-
the meaning being, If there was an opportunity to say a thing accurately,
tetsely, lucidly,·he never put it in language which could be surpassed in
polish.

9. 38. perfringeret: another reading is perstringeret.

10. 40. idern: Fleckeisen (Jahrb. ¹27) indorses a proposed change to
interdurn. H. A. Koch (Rh. Mus. 16. 485) reads tarn valde ornatus.
W. Friedrich (Jahrb. 121) would insert gravis aut before idern, and finds
a like coupling in Or. 7. 223 9. 293 de Or. 1. 10. 423 1. 12. 545 1. 18. 813

superiorem: Jahn omits,

12. 46. quod . . . natura: the Mss. reading (with controversia na-
tura) is pronounced corrupt3 eg. by LewiS‚ Harp. Lex. 3 B. and K. bracket;
other editors variously amend, eg. Jahn, gens, e controversia natam3
Peter, controversia nata 3 Ell. remarks, gens controversiis nata, conie-
cit Jacobsius eleganter, sed improbatur a Bernhardyo, quod nemo adhuc

· Siculos natura litigiosos dixerit. At Cicero ita iudicat, quod iudicialis

eloquentia apud eos orta dicebatur ‚· nec male illis, qui controversias amant,
res deberi dicitur in controversiis iudicialibus utilis. A. Tittler (Jahrb.
99) suggestS, quod esset acuta illa gens et controversia nata iuris
(de iure), artem3 and he compares pro Mil. 9. 23, controversia nulla
acti.

s 12. 48. esse: unchallenged in most editions.

13. 49. fetus: fontes is the more common reading; cf. de Or. 1. 44.
195. ’

17. 66. quod . . . Demosthenes: reads like a gloss.

18. 71. ante hunc: put by some editors at the end of the third verse
of the quotation: by Orel. and En. at the beginning of the fourth.

18. 72· atqui hic: Schiitz, Bernh., En.. and Orel. read atque ς atqui
is defended by M. Haupt (Philol. ΙΙ.) 3 cf. Pid.

20. 78. Gallus: the Mss. agree on this form, but 'Mommsen (Rh.
Mus. 16, p. 355) makes Galus the true form.

21. 83. est fama: the Mss. reading (retained by Ell. and Orel.) is est
iam; to this editors have subjoined variously opinio, sententia, etc.

22. 86. ardentior: one of many conjectural readings for the Mss,
adhortor ς among them acerbior (Orel.), attentior (Klotz), uberior
(Marg.), actuosior (B. and K.). In favor of the last, we may compare
graviter agendi, 89 ; actuose, de Or. 111. 26. 1023 in favor of ardentior,
incensus, 88, followed by gravitate,· as this word by gravius3 En„ Pid.,

and Jahn read ardentior.
