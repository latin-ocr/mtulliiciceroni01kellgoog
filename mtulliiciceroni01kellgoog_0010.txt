vi PREFACE.

The text followed is that of the Baiter δι Kayser edition of
Cicero's workS. It has been carefully compared with the re-
censions of Orelli, Ellendt, Stangl, and otherS, whose readings
are not seldom preferred. A table of the chief variations
from the B. & K. text is appended. The orthography of B. δι
Κ. is followed, with a few corrections from Brambach. The
textual noteS, placed by themselves, discuss certain disputed
readingS.

The Index of NameS, aside from its numerical referenceS‚
indicates usually the approximate chronology, and gathers
up, in quoted or unquoted passageS, a few personal items or
critical judgrnentS. There is also a General Index of certain ’
wordS, constructionS, topics, etc.
