Cum e Cilicia decedens Rhodum venissem et eo mihi ξ
de Q. Hortensii morte esset adlatum, opinione omnium
maiorem animo cepi dolorem ; nam et amico amisso cum
consuetudine iucunda tum multorum officiorum coniunc-

ince, and to that he went reluc-
tantly„ He begged his friends (eg.
Hortensius, ad Att. V. 2. 1) to see
that his ye'ar of service was not
prolonged. His administration was
able, even from a military point of
view; and so singularly incorrupt
and impartial as to win the liveliest
gratitude of the Cilicians. His year
began at the end of July, nc. 51·

decedens: early in August, Bc.

visited Boston.’ The action in de-

revertentem, Tac. Agr. 9, and Wex's
note.

Q. Hortensii: born Re. 114.
The most brilliant orator of the
decade before Cicero's fame was
established. Cf. 317 sq.

morte: the near approach of his
death had been told to Cicero by
Caelius, ad Fam. VIII. 13. 2. He
died in June, Re. 50.

Cicero cherished dislike to his only
rival. But these two greatest ora-

friends. Their last interview was
at Cicero’s Cuman villa3 ad Att. V.
