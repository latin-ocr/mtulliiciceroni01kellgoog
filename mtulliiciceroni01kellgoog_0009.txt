PREFACE.

—000—

‘ B10GRAPHY is history teaching by examples.’ In Cicero’s
account of Roman eloquence the rules of oratory are seen
applied and exemplified. Living persons stand before us in
place of abstract principles, This piece of biography is a
special literary history, not fully brought out in the general
surveys of Roman literature. A competent critic speaks of
the work as invaluable, a mine of information; one whose
delightful pages give more stimulus to an aspiring orator
than all the formal treatises of a later century.¹

This edition of the Brutus is intended for early college read-
ing. The introduction touches points of interest for those to
whom Cicero is no stranger, and includes a tolerably full con-
spectus. The notes are illustrative of the text in its historical
relations and its diction, rather than in the commonplaces of
grammar. English renderings are sparingly suggested, the
chief assistance being found in parallel passages, These pas-
sages are largely from Cicero’s other rhetorical works, and from
Quintilian. For the convenience of instructors and interested
studeam, references are added to passages not quoted. Aid
has been sought from a variety of sources ς but especial credit

is due to the editions of Ellendt, Ο. Jahn, and Piderit.
